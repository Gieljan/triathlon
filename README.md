# Triathlon of Random Identity
####Academic positioning
For our final porfolio assignment we wanted to create a game that interacting with code and external racial typing. For more information on the academic positioning you can read the 'about' section in the game.

####How the game works
Players can select a colour for an event (Maths, Running and Horse Riding). The game resets if there is a tie. If the player choses the winner of the race they will have won the event (and be returned to the menu) and if the player choses the loser, it is game over. The winners of the event are completely random.

####Problems and method
As the games and the front menu were created seperatly one of the issues was somehow getting the information from the menu into the other html (of the games). We chose to do this by actually creating seperate html files (one for each variable) per game. This is how we are able to (albeit not in the most sophisticated manner) conduct our research. We can compare pagehits for the seperate html files and this will show us who the players chose most (and least). The games were each constructed with 25 images. We both have a backrgound in graphic design so this actually seemed like a natural step for us (our react skills are still rather limited as well).


#####Possible future improvements
...We wanted to have a player select an actual colour instead of the drop down menu and we wanted these to be randomly rendered. We also wanted the order in which the colours appear in the games to be random. Instead we chose to randomly place them in a particular position.
...A feature that keeps score of whether players have won any events
...-Actually making the game somewhat fun.

####Feedback on the course
Giel: For me this was a very refreshing course that really showed me not only that having ADHD is not great for coding but mostly gave me a new insight in my field and interest. I liked the freeform nature of the course and I would definitely recommend it to others.
